# Angular Invoicing React Port

## About it

A React port of angular-invoicing. From the original [Angular Invoicing](https://metaware.github.io/angular-invoicing) repository:

Use this extremely small and lightweight project built in Angular JS to build your one off Invoices. No monthly fees, No Subscriptions - No heavy duty features, Just simple invoices.

## Usage/running the project

Clone this repository: [React Invoicing](https://github.com/emanu-dev/react-invoicing), or download the lastest release, and run the following commands:
```
// Install packages
$ npm install

// Run development server

```
